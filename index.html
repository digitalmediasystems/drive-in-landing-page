                    Coronavirus has considerably affected the film industry and likely, permanently, changed consumer habits. Businesses that fail to adapt will be left behind.

                    <h2>The Drive-In Comeback</h2>
                    <p>We are in the age of social distancing. 40,000 screens have been shuttered nationwide and exhibitors are searching for any means to generate revenue. Overwhelmingly, drive-in venues are being hailed as the answer.</p>
                    <p>But exhibitors aren't the only group that stand to benefit from these outdoor events. The drive-in format is also perfect for:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Studios, film festivals, and other release groups looking to promote their content.</li>
                        <li>Churches and religious organizations looking to continue holding services and collect tithes and offerings.</li>
                        <li>Live music and theater groups seeking to perform.</li>
                        <li>Political groups looking to hold rallies in an election season.</li>
                        <li>Restaurants with large, empty parking lots, looking to capitalize on the closure of movie theaters.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Consumers are stuck at home and anxious to get out of the house. <strong>Are you ready to capture the demand?</strong></p>

                    <h2>The Drive-In Experience</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Groups that have opened drive-in venues are seeing sold out shows even when faced with bad weather or when showing old films.</li>
                        <li>Consumers are favoring drive-in theaters when reviewing outside entertainment options largely due to the safety the concept offers them and their families.</li>
                        <li>Drive-in venues are lucrative. Operators stand to generate revenue from the sale of tickets, concessions, merchandise, advertising, and more!</li>
                        <li>Local governments continue to express that they have no objections to drive-in venues being open.</li>
                        <li>Drive-in venues are future proof. Consumers will be more vigilant after the COVID-19 pandemic passes. The traditional theater model of packing patrons in a room, elbow-to-elbow is at risk of being disrupted.</li>
